<h3>Copy Fill Color Sketch Plugin</h3>
This is a [Sketch 2](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) Plugin that provides shortcut for copying a layer's fill color to clipboard. If you need to quickly grab the hex color code of a layer within Sketch and paste it somewhere else, this plugin may save you some time.

<h3>Install</h3>

1. Download this Plugin
2. Drag and drop the plugin file to ~/library/application support/sketch/plugins or ~/Library/Containers/com.bohemiancoding.sketch/Data/Library/Application Support/sketch/Plugins (If you're running Mac Store Version)
3. The shortcut should now be available under the Plugin's menu in Sketch.

<h3>Using the Plugin</h3>
Select a layer with fill color and press <b>Shift + Command + f</b>. The hex code should now be copied to your clipboard and ready to be pasted.

<i>Note that the Shift + Command + f overwrites the Sketch default enter full screen shortcut, you can set your own shortcut by editing the plugin file to avoid conflict.<i>
